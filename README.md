## Logic Implementation

### Tuples

To handle coordinates in 3D space, we use tuples, which are divided into two types: **points** and **vectors**.

Both have x, y, z coordinates (left-handed system). To differentiate them, they include a fourth component 'w' that is set to either 1 (for points) or 0 (for vectors).

Various functions for manipulating tuples can be found in: `srcs/manage_scene/tuple/`

### Transformation Matrices

We use 4x4 matrices to apply transformations to our objects, including translation, scaling, rotation, and more. All transformations are handled through matrices.

Matrix manipulation functions are located in: `srcs/manage_scene/matrice/`

**Key concept: The Identity Matrix**

The identity matrix, when multiplied with a tuple, leaves the tuple unchanged (equivalent to multiplying by 1).

We build a global transformation matrix by successively applying individual transformation matrices (scaling, rotation, translation, etc.).

**Important principle:** Instead of transforming objects, we transform the rays (our viewpoint). This is mathematically equivalent but more efficient:
- Scaling an object up = moving closer to it
- Moving an object down = elevating our viewpoint

This approach simplifies calculations while producing identical results.
